# Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners

# Overview & Motivation

This project aims to apply several steps of data refactoring and cleaning in order to visually analyze and introduce potential data fixes to the acquired data set. Such steps can help further identify relations, recognize hidden patterns in different countries, pay attention to trending categories and generally reach conclusions and answers about many proposed questions among the data records which in our case represents Nobel Prize winners.

The following research will be held in a Q&A driven structure; meaning we will propose potential questions and put effort into trying to derive answers and conclusions.

Initially, we used the following data set found at https://www.datacamp.com/projects/441. Additional data sets may be used in order to succesfully form a tidy data with less missing values and for the sake of adding more valuable records to the existing data set. All used references will be included in the next section.
